### Spring Boot: 
Spring Boot is a Java framework that simplifies building stand-alone, production-ready Spring applications. It eliminates boilerplate code, provides embedded servers,
and follows convention over configuration, making development faster and easier.

### Standalone Application:
Applications that do not need to be deployed to an external server (eg Tomcat, Jetty).

# How are Spring Boot applications production-ready?

### Auto Configuration:

-> Spring Boot automatically configures necessary settings, such as database connections, caching, security, etc.</br>
-> You do not need to manually write many configurations.</br>

### Embedded Server:

-> Normally, an external server (like Apache Tomcat) is required to run Java web applications.</br>
-> Spring Boot comes with embedded Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow, which can run applications directly without any extra setup.</br>

### Spring Boot Actuator (Monitoring & Health Check):
-> Actuator is a feature that provides real-time monitoring and health check APIs.</br>
-> If the app is about to crash or has an issue, alerts can be generated through the Actuator.</br>

### Logging & Debugging:

-> There is a built-in logging system that helps to easily track errors and issues.</br>
-> This is helpful for debugging and performance optimization in production.</br>

### Security Features:

-> Spring Boot has default security configurations that prevent unauthorized access.</br>
-> HTTPS support and authentication/authorization can be easily configured.</br>

### Containerization & Cloud Readiness:

-> Spring Boot applications can be easily deployed on Docker, Kubernetes and cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure).</br>


### Example:
If you have built a simple web app and can deploy it directly on the server without any extra setup, then it is production-ready.</br>
Spring Boot simplifies this to achieve maximum efficiency with minimum effort.</br>

## Meaven: 
Maven is a build automation tool used for Java projects. It mainly automates project management, dependency management, and the build process.
